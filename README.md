# Docker logger
Tailing the logs of all running containers at once, and having their output interleaved into a single terminal.

This script comes from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32076878/logging-solution-for-multiple-containers-running-on-same-host
with the small change that the docker names are highlighted in green.

# Usage
`./dockerLogger.sh`
